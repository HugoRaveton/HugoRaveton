- I am Hugo Raveton (MSc. in Biology and modeling of Complex Systems)
- I am broadly interested in the physical basis of morphogenesis, that underlie phenomena such as genetic patterning, cell and tissue mechanics, cell migration and geometry, regulation networks etc.
- I use experimental and theoretical approaches to understand emergent phenomena: multi-scale analyses in developing embryos using microscopy and modeling with dynamical systems and complex networks.
