- I am Hugo Raveton (MSc. in Biology and modeling of Complex Systems)
- I am interested in how living matter is shaped during development, and in the physical basis of morphogenesis
- I use experimental and theoretical approaches to understand emergent phenomena: multi-scale analyses in developing embryos using microscopy and modeling with dynamical systems and graphs.
