- I am Hugo Raveton (MSc. in Biology and modeling of Complex Systems)
- I am broadly interested in the physical basis of cell and tissues morphogenesis
- I enjoy both experimental and theoretical approaches to understand biological phenomena, including dynamical systems, network science and thermodynamics.
